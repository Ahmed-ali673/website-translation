Some of the projects you will work on in ISOM 350 will be team based. This assignment will get you ready for that. You are required to do the following:

1. Form a team consisting of 3 members with other students from your section.
2. Designate a project manager (PM) whose responsibility will be creating the team on GitHub and assume the duties of the project manager (PM)
3. Complete the [team creation assignment on GitHub](https://classroom.github.com/g/kxc1jQKA):
   1. Project managers must first create the team, be sure to agree on a team name
   2. Team members must join the team created by the project manager
4. The team must create a readme.md file and write a single paragraph describing the final project that they would like to work on for this course.

### How to Create a Team on GitHub

Once you accept the [team creation assignment on GitHub](https://classroom.github.com/g/kxc1jQKA) you will be presented with the following screen to link your GitHub account to your student ID or skip that step if you have already done it:

Then you must create the team or join it if it has already been created:

Then accept the group assignment:

Finally, when you reach this screen, you should be done:

{{< figure src="team4.png" caption="Completed Acceptance of Assingment" >}}

Then you should see a new repository in your account for the new assignment. If not, then check your email and make sure you accept joining the mis350 organization if you have not:
