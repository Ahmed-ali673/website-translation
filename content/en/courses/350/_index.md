NOTEs: 
- List comprehensions will be introduced when needed ... next time should be part of python 230
- Readings will point to relevant Django Documentation, But I will create exercise and slides for class
- Do we use a project that we go through in class? then provide another project as a final? or get them to choose their project?
  - I think it is best if I prepare a project for them to use for the final if they do not come up with a good idea
  - Need to also to set parameters on what the project needs to be like based on the proposed project
  - Also need to think of multiple projects that we go through in class? maybe e-commerce (final project), blog, poll, dashboard for data analysis?, a search application? maybe recipies?, to-do application, reservation system, quiz application, image storage like instagram?, grading system, registration system (can be final as well), URL shortner, Kuwait News Aggregator 
- Consider including summary of the workflow for building a web application and tying it to the todo list, the ERD and how work is generally done .. display the workflow at the beginning .. in the middle .. and at the end
