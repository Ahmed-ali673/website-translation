# Important Note

- The translation involves the files under `/content/en/courses/` and `/content/ar/courses/`. You can **IGNORE** all other files.
- When in doubt, contant your instructor with questions.
- Bonus points will be based on the number of lines you translate, which can be viewed under the [insights tab](https://github.com/mis350/website-translation/graphs/contributors)

# How to Participate in Translation

1- Go to the [Project Board](https://github.com/mis350/website-translation/projects/1) and look for a tranlation task under the **To Do** column:

2- Move the task that you want to work on to the **In Progress** list and assign it to yourself, to let everyone know what you are working on:

![assign-ticket](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17110015/115770368-46f80700-a3b5-11eb-8a74-ca67fddfffe0.png)

3- Clone the `mis350/website-translation` repository on Replit.com

4- Create a branch named after the ticket you chose and your name, for example `mohammad-translate-design.md`

5- Work on the translation and continue to commit to the branch. For that, first copy the file you are translating from `/content/en/courses/` to the same directory under `/content/ar/courses/`. Then directly translate the newly copied file under `/content/ar/courses/` only.

6- Once you are done with the task, commit and push for the last time then create a pull request to merge your branch to the main branch on GitHub, and you are done!

7- Now you can find another translation task to work on


Thank you for your participation!
