# To Help Contribute to Arabic Translation

1. Fork the project to your github account
2. Check the [project board](https://github.com/mis350/website-translation/projects/1) for translation tasks and claim one task to yourself. Read the section in our course on [project management](https://malmarz.netlify.app/en/courses/350/intro/proj-mgt/) to understand why this step is important.
3. **IMPORTANT** Look for the file you want to translate under `/content/en` then copy it to the same spot under `/content/ar`. For example:

You want to translate the file `/content/en/intro/collab.md`
Then you must copy it first to `/content/ar/intro/collab.md`. This would be the copy that you trnslate to arabic.

If the file exists, then no need to copy it and start translating it. Make sure it matches the content found under the `/content/en` directory.

4. Translate the copy found under `/content/ar` to arabic.
5. If done with a file, then commit you work and send a pull request to merge your work branch to the `main` branch at `mis350/web-translation`
6. Look for another file to transelate.

### Important Note:
- I will do my best to ensure all the content found under `/content/en` to have a copy under `/content/ar`. If you cannot find the copy under the arabic directory, then please copy the file as explained in step 3. 
- Translate only the work found under `/content/ar` and `/content/en`, please ignore all other directories.

Thank you for your participation!
